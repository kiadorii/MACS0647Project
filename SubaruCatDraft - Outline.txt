SubaruSuprimeCam Catalog Format

1. Read each 'word' and check if it is a String or number

2. Once it reads a number
   Store each String word into a HEADER array
	a) Go through each index of the array and ask if the user would like to use that header
	   in the new catalog or not.
		EX: "Would you like to store -----?" 
		     Input: y
	b) If the user says yes, then save the INDEX NUMBER into an array
	   Update the HEADER array with only the wanted headers

3. Format the DATA array
	a) if there are 8 spaces before the next variable, enter a new line
		EX: val"       " nextVal
		    UPDATED:
		    val
		    nextVal
4. Compare the saved INDEX NUMBER array to the index of the DATA array.
	a) if the INDEX NUMBER and the DATA array index match
	   then store the value inside

5. Condense the DATA array futher 
	a) if there is -99.000 or -99 in that DATA line array
	   Delete the whole row
	b) if the value in the dIC index is greater than -23.5
	   Delete the whole row

6. Format the output of the arrays
	a)header+"\t"+header
	b)same number of dashes as char count in header string
	c)data values+"\t"+data values
